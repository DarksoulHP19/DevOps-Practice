why python?
shell vs python


EC2 vm not have GUI. so we need to use shell to interact with it.
shell is not good for complex tasks. so we use python.
python is easy to learn and use.

shell commands are useful for creating and managing EC2 instances,others are give description of the machine, start and stop the machine, etc.

--->shell commands vs shell scripts
shell commands are used to execute a single command at a time.
shell scripts are used to execute multiple commands at a time.

-- primary purpose of using shell scripting by devops enigneer is to get information about the machine, start and stop the machine, etc. 


---->why python?
1.ansible is written in python.(ansible is a tool used for configuration management.)
2.perform complex tasks.example: creating a web server, creating a database server, and other data manipulation opration.
so python is easy than shell scripting.

python--> rich modules and libraries
curl--> json parsing is difficult.


goal of  devops engineer:-

script--> api-->issues-->json-->parse-->get the required information
